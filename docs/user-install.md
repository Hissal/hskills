# Personal skill links

Use this route for live checkout links: core at user scope, optional packs, or
personal project extras. For a team's committed selection and release pinning,
read [Project skills and the resolver contract](project-install.md).

## Install core

From a local checkout with Node.js installed, run:

```sh
node scripts/install/install.js install
```

Install links the manifest's core list into `~/.claude/skills` and
`~/.agents/skills`. Checkout edits are live. Packs are excluded by default. Membership comes from
[`collection.json`](../collection.json); an empty selection creates no skill links. This command installs no guards,
steering or plugins.

Add the printed Claude allow rules as described under [Read permissions](#read-permissions).
Run `node scripts/install/install.js doctor`. Installation is complete when
   install and doctor exit zero and Claude can read an installed skill and its
   needed references. An empty selection verifies only the command and record,
   not skill availability. Resolve any reported conflicts using
   [Ownership and repair](#ownership-and-repair), then rerun.

## Read permissions

The command prints JSON strings for Claude `permissions.allow`, covering both
installed link paths and checkout targets. Add the printed rules yourself to
your Claude settings; the command writes no settings or permissions. Absolute
rules start with `Read(//...)`; Windows drive paths use `//c/...` form.
Claude checks both the requested link and resolved target, so allowing only
the installed folder can still deny reading skill references. See the
[Claude permission rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#read-and-edit).
Existing deny rules may still block access. The earlier observed trap and
`--add-dir` workaround are in [loading evidence](../research/lazy-loading.md).

## Personal extras

Install a whole named pack alongside core at user scope:

```sh
node scripts/install/install.js install --pack onboarding
```

The [ownership record](#ownership-and-repair) remembers selected packs. Plain `install` reruns reconcile
all remembered packs against the current manifest, adding new members and
removing only recorded links that left the selection. Core and other selected
packs remain installed. A missing remembered pack is an error before link changes.

Link one named collection skill into the current Git project:

```sh
node /path/to/collection/scripts/install/install.js install --skill tdd
# Or select the project explicitly:
node scripts/install/install.js install --skill tdd --project /path/to/project
```

This creates `.claude/skills/tdd` and `.agents/skills/tdd`, recording both in the
user ownership record. Project selections are remembered on reruns too. Skill
names must uniquely match a folder name in the manifest. The [ownership and repair rules](#ownership-and-repair) apply to both destinations.

Exact link paths are added to the repository's local Git `info/exclude`, with
new rules recorded in the ownership record. Existing rules are preserved and
never claimed or removed. Tracked paths (including tracked descendants) are
conflicts, even when missing on disk; no ignore rule is added for them. Git
worktrees use their Git-resolved exclude location. Run only in trusted project
repositories. The command never stages or commits anything and writes no project
lock. A personal extra never goes in a per-person lock.

For either extra, finish the permission and doctor steps under
[Install core](#install-core). Confirm the selected links exist in both
skill roots; project links must also be untracked in `git status`.

## Ownership and repair

`~/.skill-collection/install.json` records each link's absolute path, target
and type. Preserve this record: losing it makes existing links unrecorded
conflicts. Install reconciles the recorded set with core, removing links for
skills that left core and adding new names. A no-change rerun leaves the
record and links unchanged. Missing recorded links are recreated. An entry
is removable only while it is still a link to its recorded target; a replaced
file, directory or link is reported and preserved. Unrecorded targets,
including existing links to the fork or even to this checkout, are always
conflicts. Move conflicts aside yourself when you intend to transfer ownership.
A replaced entry remains in the record for doctor to report.

Install ends with doctor; doctor also runs independently without writing files
or requiring the checkout manifest. Missing, replaced, dangling or invalid
recorded targets fail doctor. Conflicts and doctor failures exit nonzero.
There is no automatic rollback of successful links if another entry conflicts;
the record retains successful writes. Use one installer process at a time.

Linux and macOS use directory symlinks. Windows tries a directory symlink,
then a junction if Windows refuses permission or support for symlinks. Each
created link reports its type, also retained in the record and doctor output.
No symlinks are committed to git.

## Isolated verification

`--home DIR` changes the record home and default skill roots; `--source DIR`
selects a fixture checkout; `--claude-root DIR` and `--agents-root DIR`
override the two destination directories. All overrides are absolute-resolved.
Use temporary directories for all of these to avoid touching a real home.
The table-driven CLI cases run with real temporary directories through
`node scripts/install/test/run.js` and inside the collection check. They
exercise ownership, reconciliation, no-change reruns and doctor failures.

Windows hand validation is still missing for #116. On Windows, run the cases
and perform isolated installs with symlink permission enabled and disabled;
record both the symlink and junction outcomes on #116, including doctor and
permission-rule output. Linux automated results do not establish either
Windows outcome, so #116 is not fully complete.
